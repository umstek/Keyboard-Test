# Keyboard-Test

Shows what key is pressed, and the modifiers if any. Shows a list of pressed keys.  

Created this to test my malfunctioning keyboard. And then realized that I can use it to detect 
strange key combinations used by various latop manufacturers for their multimedia keys, 
project key etc.
